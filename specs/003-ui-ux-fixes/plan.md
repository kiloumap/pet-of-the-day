# Implementation Plan: UI/UX Fixes and Mobile App Improvements

**Branch**: `003-ui-ux-fixes` | **Date**: 2025-09-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-ui-ux-fixes/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Comprehensive UI/UX fixes and improvements across the React Native mobile app addressing broken navigation, missing translations, non-functional buttons, layout issues, and TypeScript compliance problems. Focus on fixing invitation management, pet detail screens, profile editing, group management, and ensuring proper French localization throughout the application.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, React Native with Expo SDK 49+
**Primary Dependencies**: React Native, Expo, Redux Toolkit, React Navigation, React Hook Form, Yup
**Storage**: Redux state management, API integration with Go backend
**Testing**: Jest, React Native Testing Library, TypeScript compiler for type checking
**Target Platform**: iOS 15+ and Android 8+ mobile devices
**Project Type**: mobile - React Native app with Go API backend
**Performance Goals**: 60 fps scrolling, <300ms navigation transitions, instant UI feedback
**Constraints**: TypeScript compliance required, French/English i18n support, theme system compatibility
**Scale/Scope**: ~15 screens affected, multiple navigation flows, comprehensive translation updates

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Constitutional Requirements Assessment
- **✅ Code Quality & Architecture**: UI fixes align with React Native + TypeScript standards, maintain component architecture
- **✅ Test-Driven Development**: Will maintain existing test coverage and add tests for fixed functionality
- **✅ User Experience First**: Primary focus on fixing broken UX, improving navigation, and responsive design
- **✅ Internationalization & Theming**: Addresses missing French translations and ensures theme system compliance
- **✅ Performance & Efficiency**: Fixes will improve app responsiveness and navigation performance
- **✅ Error Handling & Resilience**: Addresses broken functionality and improves error states (empty leaderboards)
- **✅ Consistency & Standardization**: Aligns UI patterns and removes inconsistent navigation elements

### Gate Status: **PASS** - All constitutional principles are supported by this feature

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)
api/
└── [same as backend above]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 3 (Mobile + API) - React Native mobile app structure with separate backend API

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Focus on UI/UX fixes rather than full feature development
- Each broken functionality → diagnostic + fix task pair
- Each UI improvement → design + implementation task
- Each translation gap → translation audit + completion task

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Foundation Tasks**: TypeScript compliance, navigation consolidation
2. **Functionality Restoration**: Broken buttons, navigation, CRUD operations
3. **UI/UX Improvements**: Layout fixes, visual improvements, empty states
4. **Localization**: Complete French translations, translation coverage
5. **Testing**: Component tests for fixed functionality
6. **Polish**: Performance improvements, accessibility enhancements

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Foundation first: TypeScript compliance enables development
- Navigation fixes: Core user flow functionality
- Feature restoration: Pet management, invitations, profile editing
- UI polish: Layout, translations, visual improvements
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where components are independent

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- 8-10 TypeScript compliance tasks
- 6-8 Navigation and routing fixes
- 8-10 Feature functionality restoration tasks
- 6-8 UI/UX improvement tasks
- 4-6 Translation and localization tasks
- 3-5 Testing and validation tasks

**Critical Path Dependencies**:
1. TypeScript fixes must complete before other development
2. Navigation consolidation before feature fixes
3. Component fixes before UI polish
4. Core functionality before performance optimization

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
