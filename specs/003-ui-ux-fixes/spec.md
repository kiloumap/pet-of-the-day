# Feature Specification: UI/UX Fixes and Mobile App Improvements

**Feature Branch**: `003-ui-ux-fixes`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "fix and improvments. I identified many issues with yarn run type-check, also i see on the front a pending invit i have no way to accept, refuse, remove it. the notebook for pets are not anywhere. I also found many text not translated, i did the profile in french, but its missing a lot. on the homepage, myPet part is not centered. And the button to go to any pet detail are not working. Add animal and view all pet either. On pet detail i can not see any part for adding the notes, coOwners, personatilities, the both ddedlete are not working. also this screen should have a serious rewamp. On groups tab, i cant remove any groups, the leaderboard screen are not working if there is no score or pet. we should disabled it or found a way to inform the user. On profile, even if i add score, i cant see the number mooving for my pets. I also believe that pets should not be on profile as they have a dedicated tabs for them, On profil i cant change any information for the user such as name, password... On param, i dont want the handleEditProfile button anymore as profile has a entire tabs for this."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Multiple UI/UX issues identified across mobile app
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: pet owners, group members
   ’ Actions: navigation, invitation management, pet management, profile editing
   ’ Data: invitations, pet notes, translations, user profiles
   ’ Constraints: TypeScript compliance, French localization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flows for each major issue area
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement addresses specific broken functionality
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Focus on user experience improvements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a pet owner using the mobile app, I want all interface elements to function correctly and display in my preferred language so that I can effectively manage my pets, groups, and profile without encountering broken functionality or untranslated text.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a pending group invitation, **When** I view the invitations section, **Then** I should see options to accept, decline, or dismiss the invitation
2. **Given** I'm on the home screen, **When** I view the "My Pets" section, **Then** the content should be properly centered and visually aligned
3. **Given** I'm viewing a pet detail screen, **When** I want to add notes or manage co-owners, **Then** I should see dedicated sections for these actions with working functionality
4. **Given** I select French as my language, **When** I navigate to any screen, **Then** all text should be properly translated including profile sections
5. **Given** I'm on the profile screen, **When** I want to edit my user information, **Then** I should be able to modify name, password, and other personal details
6. **Given** I'm viewing a group's leaderboard with no scores, **When** the screen loads, **Then** I should see an informative message rather than a broken interface
7. **Given** I want to add a new pet, **When** I tap the add pet button, **Then** the navigation should work and take me to the pet creation form
8. **Given** I earn points for pet behaviors, **When** I view my profile, **Then** the updated point totals should be reflected immediately

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user has multiple pending invitations?
- How does the system handle pet notebooks when no notes exist yet?
- What occurs when groups have no members for leaderboard display?
- How should the app behave when switching between languages mid-session?
