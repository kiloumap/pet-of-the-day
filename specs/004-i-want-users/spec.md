# Feature Specification: Pet Behavior Logging with Point System

**Feature Branch**: `004-i-want-users`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want users to be able to log their pets' behaviors with a point system. Each behavior has a positive or negative value (ex: +5 for going potty outside, -3 for indoor accident). Points accumulate throughout the day to create a real-time ranking in each group. At the end of the day, the pet with the most points becomes "Pet of the Day". Users can choose which groups to share each behavior with."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: pet owners (actors), behavior logging (action), point system (data), group sharing (constraint)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Behavior definition/management needs clarification
   � "End of day" timing needs clarification
   � Point accumulation reset schedule needs clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flow clear: log behavior � assign points � view rankings � Pet of the Day selection
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement testable and specific
   � Some ambiguous requirements marked for clarification
6. Identify Key Entities (behavior logging involves data)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Some [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items present
   � No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a pet owner in a group, I want to log my pet's daily behaviors and see how they stack up against other pets in real-time rankings, with the highest-scoring pet becoming "Pet of the Day" to encourage positive pet training and create friendly competition within pet communities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a pet in a group, **When** I log a positive behavior (e.g., "went potty outside"), **Then** my pet's points increase by the behavior's value and the group leaderboard updates in real-time
2. **Given** my pet has accumulated points during the day, **When** the day ends, **Then** the pet with the most points in each group is crowned "Pet of the Day"
3. **Given** I want to log a behavior, **When** I select which groups to share it with, **Then** the behavior and points only appear in the selected groups' rankings
4. **Given** I log a negative behavior (e.g., "indoor accident"), **When** the points are applied, **Then** my pet's total score decreases and the ranking adjusts accordingly
5. **Given** multiple pets have the same highest score at day's end, **When** determining Pet of the Day, **Then** the pet with fewer negative behaviors wins; if still tied, multiple pets can share the title

### Edge Cases
- When a user tries to log behavior for a pet not in any groups, system prompts to create a new group with explicit message
- How does the system handle logging behaviors for the same pet across multiple time zones?
- What occurs if a user attempts to log behaviors retroactively for previous days?
- How are points handled if a pet leaves a group mid-day after accumulating points?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to log specific behaviors for their pets with associated point values
- **FR-002**: System MUST support both positive and negative point values for different behaviors
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain real-time point accumulation and ranking within each group
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to select which groups receive each logged behavior
- **FR-005**: System MUST determine and display "Pet of the Day" based on highest daily point total, with ties broken by fewest negative behaviors, allowing multiple winners if still tied
- **FR-006**: System MUST reset daily point accumulation at a customizable time per user (defaulting to 9PM in user's timezone)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a predefined catalog of behaviors with fixed point values
- **FR-008**: System MUST display current rankings and point totals to group members
- **FR-009**: System MUST retain individual behavior logs for 6 months and daily scoring summaries indefinitely
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that users can only log behaviors for pets they own or co-own
- **FR-011**: System MUST enforce minimum time intervals between logging the same behavior for the same pet

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Behavior**: Represents a specific pet action with associated point value, name, and description
- **BehaviorLog**: Records when a specific behavior was logged for a pet, including timestamp, points awarded, and target groups
- **DailyScore**: Tracks accumulated points for each pet per day within each group
- **PetOfTheDay**: Records daily winners for each group with date and final score
- **GroupRanking**: Real-time leaderboard showing current standings within a group

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: When should daily points reset for "Pet of the Day" calculation? → A: Custom time with user's timezone 9PM per default
- Q: How should behaviors be managed in the system? → A: Only predefined behaviors (system-provided list)
- Q: Can users log the same behavior multiple times per day for the same pet? → A: Time-based restrictions (minimum interval)
- Q: How long should behavior logs and scoring history be retained? → A: Logs 6 months, scoring lifetime
- Q: What happens when a user tries to log behavior for a pet not in any groups they belong to? → A: Prompt to create a new group with explicit message
