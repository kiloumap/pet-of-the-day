# Feature Specification: User Integration System

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-user-integration`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement user integration I want a user system where each person can create an account and register multiple pets. For each pet, we should be able to add a photo, name, breed, birth date, personality traits. A pet always has one main owner, but can have co-owners who can also log actions for that pet. I also want a "notebook" for each pet with medical info, diet, habits, commands they know - this notebook should be shareable with other users."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: user accounts, pet registration, ownership models, pet data, notebook system, sharing
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flow: account creation � pet registration � data management � sharing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (pet data system)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: Given that an existing mobile frontend already has user authentication, pet registration, and management features, how should this new user integration system relate to the existing frontend? → A: Replace existing frontend completely with new implementation
- Q: For pet names uniqueness, what scope should be enforced? → A: Pet names must be unique only per individual owner
- Q: What is the maximum number of personality traits allowed per pet? → A: 5
- Q: For photo uploads, what file size and type restrictions should be enforced? → A: 15MB max, any image format
- Q: Should pet ownership be transferrable between users? → A: No, primary ownership is permanent and cannot be changed

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a pet owner, I want to create an account and register my pets so that I can track their information, manage their care records, and share relevant data with other caregivers like family members, veterinarians, or pet sitters.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the platform, **When** they create an account with valid information, **Then** they can access their personal dashboard
2. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they register a new pet with required information (name, breed, birth date), **Then** the pet appears in their pet list as the primary owner
3. **Given** a pet owner, **When** they add a co-owner to their pet, **Then** the co-owner can view and update the pet's information and notebook entries
4. **Given** a pet with recorded information, **When** the owner creates notebook entries (medical, diet, habits, commands), **Then** the entries are saved and accessible to authorized users
5. **Given** a pet owner, **When** they share a pet's notebook with another user via email, **Then** the shared user can view (but not modify) the notebook contents
6. **Given** an authorized user, **When** they add personality traits to a pet, **Then** the traits are saved and visible to other authorized users

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to register a pet with duplicate name for the same owner?
- How does the system handle sharing with non-existent email addresses?
- What occurs when a co-owner relationship is revoked?
- How are privacy and access controls maintained when sharing notebooks?
