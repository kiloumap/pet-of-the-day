## Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
- **Database Schema**: T004-T014 must complete before T025-T026
- **Contract Tests**: T015-T024 must FAIL before any implementation (T027+)
- **Backend Domain**: T027-T050 must complete before API interfaces (T051-T058)
- **Backend APIs**: T051-T058 must complete before mobile integration (T099-T103)
- **Mobile Setup**: T062-T065 must complete before any mobile screens
- **Core Mobile**: T066-T098 must complete before integration testing (T108-T113)

### Parallel Execution Blockers
- T025 blocks all schema-dependent tasks
- T051-T058 share `/backend/cmd/api/main.go` (sequential)
- T055-T058 must be sequential (same file modifications)
- All contract tests (T015-T024) can run in parallel
- All mobile component creation (T067+) can run in parallel within feature areas

Task: "Create Sharing domain entities in /backend/internal/sharing/domain/entity.go"
Task: "Extend User domain with co-ownership in /backend/internal/user/domain/entity.go"
Task: "Extend Pet domain with personality traits in /backend/internal/pet/domain/entity.go"
```

### Mobile Components (Phase 3.5)
```bash
# Mobile screens can be built in parallel:
Task: "Create login screen in /mobile/src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx"
Task: "Create pet list screen in /mobile/src/screens/pets/PetListScreen.tsx"
Task: "Create notebook screen with tabs in /mobile/src/screens/notebook/NotebookScreen.tsx"
Task: "Create shared notebooks screen in /mobile/src/screens/sharing/SharedNotebooksScreen.tsx"
```
