# Research: User Integration System

## Frontend Replacement Strategy

### Decision: Complete Frontend Replacement
**Rationale**: Based on clarification, the existing React Native frontend will be completely replaced rather than incrementally enhanced. This provides maximum flexibility for implementing the comprehensive user integration system with personality traits, notebook system, and sharing features.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Incremental enhancement of existing frontend - Rejected due to complexity of integrating new features with existing architecture
- Parallel development with gradual migration - Rejected due to maintenance overhead and user confusion

### Key Research Areas

## 1. Backend Integration Requirements

### Existing Backend Analysis
The current backend already has substantial infrastructure:
- **User Management**: Complete authentication system with JWT tokens
- **Pet Management**: Full CRUD operations for pets with owner relationships
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-established DDD patterns with bounded contexts
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Ent ORM, existing schemas for users and pets

### Required Backend Extensions
**Decision**: Extend existing backend rather than replace
**Rationale**: Existing backend architecture follows Clean Architecture principles and can be extended with new bounded contexts

**Backend Changes Needed**:
1. **New Bounded Contexts**:
   - `petprofiles/` - Personality traits management
   - `notebook/` - Notebook entries and sharing system
2. **Database Schema Extensions**:
   - Personality traits tables with trait types and intensity levels
   - Notebook entry tables with specialized types (medical, diet, habits, commands)
   - Sharing permissions tables with read-only access controls
   - Co-ownership relationship tables
3. **API Endpoints**:
   - Personality trait CRUD operations
   - Notebook entry management across 4 specialized types
   - Sharing and permission management
   - Co-ownership relationship management

## 2. Frontend Architecture Strategy

### Decision: React Native with Complete Rewrite
**Rationale**:
- Existing mobile framework (React Native + Expo) is solid and constitutional-compliant
- Complete rewrite allows clean implementation of new features without legacy constraints
- Can leverage existing component patterns and theme system

**Key Technologies**:
- **React Native + TypeScript**: Type safety and component-based architecture
- **Expo Framework**: Cross-platform compatibility and development efficiency
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management with async thunks for API integration
- **React Navigation**: Type-safe navigation between screens
- **React Hook Form + Yup**: Consistent form validation and error handling
- **React Query**: API caching and synchronization for notebook data

### Component Architecture Strategy
**Decision**: Atomic Design with Specialized Components
**Components Needed**:
1. **Authentication Components**:
   - LoginScreen, RegisterScreen, PasswordResetScreen
2. **Pet Management Components**:
   - PetRegistrationForm, PetListScreen, PetDetailScreen
   - PersonalityTraitSelector, PersonalityTraitDisplay
3. **Notebook Components**:
   - NotebookScreen with tab navigation (Medical, Diet, Habits, Commands)
   - MedicalEntryForm, DietEntryForm, HabitEntryForm, CommandEntryForm
   - NotebookEntryList with filtering and search
4. **Sharing Components**:
   - ShareNotebookModal, SharedNotebooksScreen
   - PermissionManagementScreen
5. **Co-ownership Components**:
   - CoOwnerInviteModal, CoOwnerManagementScreen

## 3. Data Management Strategy

### Decision: Redux Toolkit with React Query
**Rationale**:
- Redux Toolkit for global state (user, authentication, pets)
- React Query for server state (notebook entries, sharing data) with optimistic updates
- Clear separation between client state and server state

**State Architecture**:
```
store/
├── authSlice.ts       # User authentication and profile
├── petSlice.ts        # Pet list and selected pet
├── personalitySlice.ts # Personality traits management
└── sharingSlice.ts    # Sharing permissions and co-ownership
```

**API Service Strategy**:
- Centralized API service with typed endpoints
- Automatic token management and refresh
- Error handling with typed error responses
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## 4. Testing Strategy

### Decision: Comprehensive Testing Pyramid
**Frontend Testing**:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for utility functions and hooks
- **Component Tests**: React Native Testing Library for component behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Full screen testing with mocked API responses
- **E2E Tests**: Detox for critical user journeys

**Backend Testing** (for new features):
- **Unit Tests**: Domain logic and value object validation
- **Integration Tests**: Repository implementations with test database
- **HTTP Tests**: Controller endpoint testing
- **Contract Tests**: API contract validation

## 5. Performance Optimization

### Decision: Performance-First Implementation
**Strategies**:
1. **Lazy Loading**: Screen-based code splitting
2. **Image Optimization**: Photo compression and caching (15MB limit support)
3. **List Virtualization**: For large notebook entry lists
4. **Offline Support**: Core features work without network
5. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback for user actions

## 6. User Experience Considerations

### Decision: Mobile-First with Native Feel
**Key UX Principles**:
1. **Intuitive Navigation**: Tab-based navigation with stack navigators
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features revealed as needed
3. **Consistent Interactions**: Standard mobile gesture support
4. **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with action suggestions
5. **Loading States**: Skeleton screens for all async operations

## Implementation Readiness Assessment

### Backend Readiness: 70%
- ✅ Architecture foundation exists
- ✅ User and pet management working
- ⚠️ Need to implement personality traits bounded context
- ⚠️ Need to implement notebook bounded context
- ⚠️ Need to implement sharing system

### Frontend Readiness: 0% (Complete Rewrite)
- ✅ Technology stack decided
- ✅ Architecture patterns defined
- ❌ Complete implementation needed

### Infrastructure Readiness: 90%
- ✅ Database and ORM working
- ✅ Authentication system operational
- ✅ Development environment established
- ⚠️ Need photo upload handling (15MB limit)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Data Migration**: If existing users need to be preserved during frontend replacement
2. **Photo Upload Performance**: 15MB files on mobile networks
3. **Sharing Complexity**: Email-based sharing with permission management

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Phased Rollout**: Backend extensions first, then frontend replacement
2. **Photo Optimization**: Client-side compression before upload
3. **Sharing UX**: Clear permission states and intuitive sharing flow

## Next Phase Requirements

All research complete. No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remaining. Ready for Phase 1 design and contracts.
