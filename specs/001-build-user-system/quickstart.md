## Quick Validation Test

This quickstart validates the complete pet notebook feature through user scenarios matching the specification requirements.

### Prerequisites
- Backend server running on http://localhost:8080
- Mobile app connected to backend
- Test user account with at least one pet registered

### Scenario 1: Add Personality Traits (FR-001, FR-002, FR-003)

**Goal**: Verify pet owners can add and manage personality traits

```bash
# 1. Get existing pet
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/pets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN"

# Expected: List of user's pets with basic info
# Save pet ID for next steps

# 2. Add personality traits
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/personality" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "traits": [
      {
        "trait_type": "playful",
        "intensity_level": 4,
        "notes": "Loves fetch and toys"
      },
      {
        "custom_trait": "Very vocal",
        "intensity_level": 3,
        "notes": "Barks to communicate needs"
      }
    ]
  }'

# Expected: 201 Created with trait data
# Verify both predefined and custom traits are supported

# 3. Retrieve personality traits
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/personality" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN"

# Expected: 200 OK with array of personality traits
# Verify traits are persisted correctly
```

**Mobile Validation**:
1. Open pet details screen
2. Navigate to "Personality" tab
3. Verify traits display correctly with intensity levels
4. Test adding new trait via mobile UI
5. Verify both predefined and custom trait options available

### Scenario 2: Create Notebook Entries (FR-005, FR-006, FR-007, FR-008)

**Goal**: Verify notebook creation and entry management

      "frequency": "daily",
      "location": "Living room",
      "severity": 1
    }
  }'

# Expected: 201 Created with habit-specific tracking

# 4. Add command entry
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/notebook/entries" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entry_type": "commands",
    "title": "Sit Command Training",
    "content": "Working on consistent sit response before meals",
    "date_occurred": "2025-09-21",
    "specialized_data": {

**Mobile Validation**:
1. Navigate to pet's "Notebook" section
2. Verify all four categories (Medical, Diet, Habits, Commands) are available
3. Test adding entry through mobile forms
4. Verify specialized fields appear based on entry type
5. Confirm entries display with proper formatting and author info

### Scenario 3: Notebook Sharing (FR-012, FR-013, FR-014, FR-015)

**Goal**: Verify sharing permissions and access control

```bash
# 1. Grant notebook access to another user
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/notebook/share" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_email": "friend@example.com",
    "permission_level": "read_only"
  }'

# Expected: 201 Created with sharing permission details

# 2. View current sharing permissions (owner only)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/notebook/share" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN"

# Expected: 200 OK with list of active shares

# 3. Test shared user access
# Login as shared user and get their JWT token
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/notebook" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SHARED_USER_JWT"

# Expected: 200 OK with full notebook access but can_edit: false, can_share: false

# 4. Test shared user cannot modify sharing
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/notebook/share" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SHARED_USER_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_email": "another@example.com"}'

# Expected: 403 Forbidden - only owners can manage sharing

# 5. Revoke access
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/notebook/share/{SHARED_USER_ID}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN"

# Expected: 204 No Content - access revoked

# 6. Verify revoked access
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/notebook" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SHARED_USER_JWT"

# Expected: 403 Forbidden - access no longer available
```

**Mobile Validation**:
1. As pet owner, access notebook sharing settings
2. Add share via email input
3. Verify shared user appears in sharing list
4. Login as shared user and verify:
   - Can view notebook entries
   - Cannot access sharing settings
   - Cannot modify sharing permissions
5. As owner, revoke access and verify shared user loses access

### Scenario 4: Co-owner Permissions (FR-016, FR-017)

**Goal**: Verify co-owners can add entries but not manage sharing

```bash
# Prerequisites: Pet has co-owner added (existing functionality)
# Login as co-owner and get JWT token

# 1. Co-owner adds notebook entry
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/notebook/entries" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CO_OWNER_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entry_type": "medical",
    "title": "Emergency Vet Visit",
    "content": "Pet ingested foreign object, X-ray and monitoring required",
    "date_occurred": "2025-09-23",
    "specialized_data": {
      "veterinarian_name": "Emergency Animal Hospital",
      "treatment_type": "emergency",
      "cost": 450.00
    }
  }'

# Expected: 201 Created - co-owners can add entries

# 2. Verify entry attribution
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/notebook" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN"

# Expected: Entry shows co-owner as author in audit trail

# 3. Co-owner attempts to manage sharing
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/notebook/share" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CO_OWNER_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_email": "someone@example.com"}'

# Expected: 403 Forbidden - co-owners cannot manage sharing
```

### Scenario 5: Data Validation and Constraints

**Goal**: Verify business rules and data validation

```bash
# 1. Test maximum personality traits (max 10)
# Add 11 traits and verify rejection
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/personality" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "traits": [
      {"trait_type": "playful", "intensity_level": 3},
      {"trait_type": "calm", "intensity_level": 2},
      {"trait_type": "energetic", "intensity_level": 4},
      {"trait_type": "shy", "intensity_level": 1},
      {"trait_type": "friendly", "intensity_level": 5},
      {"trait_type": "anxious", "intensity_level": 2},
      {"trait_type": "confident", "intensity_level": 4},
      {"trait_type": "social", "intensity_level": 3},
      {"trait_type": "independent", "intensity_level": 2},
      {"custom_trait": "Loyal", "intensity_level": 5},
      {"custom_trait": "Stubborn", "intensity_level": 3}
    ]
  }'

# Expected: 400 Bad Request - exceeds 10 trait limit

# 2. Test invalid intensity level
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/personality" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "traits": [{"trait_type": "playful", "intensity_level": 6}]
  }'

# Expected: 400 Bad Request - intensity must be 1-5

# 3. Test future date validation
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/pets/{PET_ID}/notebook/entries" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entry_type": "medical",
    "title": "Future appointment",
    "content": "Scheduled checkup",
    "date_occurred": "2026-12-31"
  }'

# Expected: 400 Bad Request - date_occurred cannot be in future
```
