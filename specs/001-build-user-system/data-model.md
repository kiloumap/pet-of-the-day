## Database Schema Extensions

### New Ent Schema Files

**backend/ent/schema/pet_personality.go**:
```go
type PetPersonality struct {
    ent.Schema
}

func (PetPersonality) Fields() []ent.Field {
    return []ent.Field{
        field.UUID("id", uuid.UUID{}).Default(uuid.New).Immutable(),
        field.Enum("trait_type").Values("playful", "calm", "energetic", "shy", "aggressive", "friendly", "anxious", "confident", "social", "independent").Optional(),
        field.String("custom_trait").MaxLen(100).Optional(),
        field.Int("intensity_level").Range(1, 5),
        field.Text("notes").Optional(),
        field.Time("created_at").Default(time.Now).Immutable(),
        field.Time("updated_at").Default(time.Now).UpdateDefault(time.Now),
    }
}

func (PetPersonality) Edges() []ent.Edge {
    return []ent.Edge{
        edge.From("pet", Pet.Type).Ref("personality_traits").Unique().Required(),
    }
}
```

**backend/ent/schema/pet_notebook.go**:
```go
type PetNotebook struct {
    ent.Schema
}

func (PetNotebook) Fields() []ent.Field {
    return []ent.Field{
        field.UUID("id", uuid.UUID{}).Default(uuid.New).Immutable(),
        field.Time("created_at").Default(time.Now).Immutable(),
        field.Time("updated_at").Default(time.Now).UpdateDefault(time.Now),
        field.Int("entry_count").Default(0),
        field.Time("last_entry_date").Optional(),
    }
}

func (PetNotebook) Edges() []ent.Edge {
    return []ent.Edge{
        edge.From("pet", Pet.Type).Ref("notebook").Unique().Required(),
        edge.To("entries", NotebookEntry.Type),
        edge.To("shares", NotebookShare.Type),
    }
}
```

### Updated Pet Schema
**backend/ent/schema/pet.go** (additions):
```go
// Add to existing Pet edges
edge.To("personality_traits", PetPersonality.Type),
edge.To("notebook", PetNotebook.Type).Unique(),
```

## State Transitions

### Notebook Lifecycle
1. **Created**: When first entry is added to a pet
2. **Active**: Contains entries, can be shared
3. **Shared**: Has active sharing permissions
4. **Archived**: Pet is archived/deleted (soft delete)

### Sharing Permissions
1. **Pending**: Invitation sent (future feature)
2. **Active**: User has access to notebook
3. **Revoked**: Access removed by owner

### Training Commands
1. **Learning**: Just started training this command
2. **Practicing**: Pet knows command but inconsistent
3. **Mastered**: Pet reliably responds to command
4. **Needs Work**: Was mastered but regression occurred

## Indexes and Performance

### Required Database Indexes
```sql
-- Query notebooks by pet efficiently
CREATE INDEX idx_pet_notebook_pet_id ON pet_notebooks(pet_id);

-- Query entries by notebook and type for filtered views
CREATE INDEX idx_notebook_entry_notebook_type_date ON notebook_entries(notebook_id, entry_type, date_occurred DESC);

-- Query shared notebooks by user
CREATE INDEX idx_notebook_share_user_status ON notebook_shares(shared_with_user_id, status);

-- Query personality traits by pet
CREATE INDEX idx_pet_personality_pet_id ON pet_personalities(pet_id);

-- Full-text search on entry content (future feature)
CREATE INDEX idx_notebook_entry_content_fts ON notebook_entries USING gin(to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || content));
```

### Pagination Strategy
- Notebook entries: 20 per page, ordered by `date_occurred DESC`
- Personality traits: All loaded (max 10 per pet)
- Shared notebooks: 10 per page for user's shared access list

## Validation Summary

### Business Rules Enforced at Domain Level
- Pet owners can only modify their own pets' notebooks
- Co-owners can add entries but cannot manage sharing
- Shared users have read-only access
- Maximum 10 personality traits per pet
- Specialized entry types must match parent entry type
- Future dates not allowed for historical entries

### Data Integrity Constraints
- Foreign key relationships enforced at database level
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate data
- Check constraints validate enum values and ranges
- NOT NULL constraints ensure required data is present
