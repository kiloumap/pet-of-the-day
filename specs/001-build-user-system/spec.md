# Feature Specification: Pet Notebook System and Missing User Features

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-user-system`
**Created**: September 23, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build user system I want a user system where each person can create an account and register multiple pets. For each pet, we should be able to add a photo, name, breed, birth date, personality traits. A pet always has one main owner, but can have co-owners who can also log actions for that pet. I also want a "notebook" for each pet with medical info, diet, habits, commands they know - this notebook should be shareable with other users. The main feature is already developped and implemented, that will require an analyze first to check what is missing, or any incoherence or non consistency"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’  Feature description analyzed - user system analysis and pet notebook implementation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’  Identified: existing user/pet system, missing personality traits, missing pet notebook functionality, sharing mechanism
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’  Marked unclear requirements with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’  Defined user flows for notebook creation, sharing, and management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’  Each requirement is testable and focused on missing functionality
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’  New entities: PetPersonality, PetNotebook, NotebookEntry, NotebookShare
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’  No implementation details, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Analysis Summary

**Existing Implementation Status:**
-  **User System**: Complete with authentication, registration, profile management
-  **Pet Registration**: Name, species, breed, birth date, photo upload
-  **Co-ownership**: Pet owners can add co-owners who have access to pets
- L **Personality Traits**: Not implemented
- L **Pet Notebook**: No medical info, diet, habits, or commands tracking
- L **Notebook Sharing**: No sharing mechanism for pet information

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a pet owner, I want to maintain a comprehensive digital notebook for each of my pets containing their personality traits, medical history, dietary information, behavioral habits, and known commands, so that I can provide better care and easily share this information with veterinarians, pet sitters, or other caretakers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I own a pet, **When** I access the pet's profile, **Then** I can add and edit personality traits from predefined categories
2. **Given** I have a pet with a notebook, **When** I add a medical entry, **Then** the entry is saved with a timestamp and category
3. **Given** I want to share pet information, **When** I grant access to another user, **Then** they can view (but not edit) my pet's notebook
4. **Given** I am a co-owner of a pet, **When** I access the notebook, **Then** I can add entries but cannot change sharing permissions
5. **Given** I have shared access to a pet's notebook, **When** I view the notebook, **Then** I can see all entries but cannot modify sharing settings

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a pet owner removes co-owner access while they have an active notebook session?
- How does the system handle conflicting medical information added by different co-owners?
- What occurs when a user tries to share a notebook with someone who doesn't have an account?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Personality Traits System
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow pet owners to select personality traits from predefined categories (e.g., "Playful", "Calm", "Energetic", "Shy", "Aggressive", "Friendly")
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow custom personality trait descriptions in addition to predefined options
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to update personality traits at any time
- **FR-004**: Personality traits MUST be visible to all users with access to the pet's information

#### Pet Notebook System
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a digital notebook for each pet containing four main sections: Medical, Diet, Habits, and Commands
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to add dated entries to any notebook section
- **FR-007**: System MUST support different entry types: text notes, lists, and structured data forms
- **FR-008**: Medical entries MUST include fields for date, description, veterinarian, and optional attachments
- **FR-009**: Diet entries MUST track food types, quantities, feeding schedules, and dietary restrictions
- **FR-010**: Habit entries MUST capture behavioral patterns, triggers, and frequencies
- **FR-011**: Command entries MUST list known commands, training status, and success rates

#### Notebook Sharing System
- **FR-012**: Pet owners MUST be able to grant read-only access to their pet's notebook to other users
- **FR-013**: System MUST support sharing via email invitation or username search
- **FR-014**: Shared users MUST be able to view all notebook sections but cannot modify sharing permissions
- **FR-015**: Pet owners MUST be able to revoke sharing access at any time
- **FR-016**: Co-owners MUST be able to add entries to notebooks but cannot modify sharing permissions
- **FR-017**: System MUST maintain an audit log of who added each notebook entry

#### Data Privacy and Access Control
- **FR-018**: System MUST ensure only authorized users can access pet notebooks
- **FR-019**: Shared notebook access MUST be limited to the specific pet, not all pets owned by the user
- **FR-020**: Users MUST be able to export their pet's notebook data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export format not specified - PDF, JSON, CSV?]

### Key Entities

- **PetPersonality**: Represents personality traits associated with a pet
  - Attributes: trait type (predefined/custom), description, intensity level
  - Relationships: belongs to one pet

- **PetNotebook**: Container for all notebook information for a specific pet
  - Attributes: creation date, last modified date, privacy settings
  - Relationships: belongs to one pet, has many notebook entries

- **NotebookEntry**: Individual entry within a pet's notebook
  - Attributes: entry type (medical/diet/habits/commands), content, date, author
  - Relationships: belongs to one notebook, created by one user

- **NotebookShare**: Represents sharing permissions for pet notebooks
  - Attributes: permission level (read-only), granted date, status (active/revoked)
  - Relationships: links user to pet notebook, created by pet owner

- **MedicalEntry**: Specialized notebook entry for medical information
